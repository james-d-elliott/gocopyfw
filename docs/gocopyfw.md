Copy File Watcher for IntelliJ that copies files

### Synopsis

Copy File Watcher for IntelliJ that just copies files

To setup the watcher you need to follow these steps:

  4. Enter the following details:
     * Name: gocopyfw
     * File Type: Any
     * Scope: Project Files
     * Program: gocopyfw (or the path to the binary)
     * Arguments: -d $ProjectFileDir$ -f $FilePath$ -l [filesets]
       * see examples for what filesets are
  5. Advanced Options: All Unchecked
  6. Show Console: On Error


```
gocopyfw [flags]
```

### Examples

```
Most of the arguments are provided by IntelliJ, the only one you really have to configure is the
--linked-files or -l option which takes a list of FileSet's separated by commas. Each FileSet is a list of unique files
separated by a semi-colon. Each FileSet can be as many files as you wish, as long as it's more than one. Usually each
File should keep the respective slash used to denote a directory as a prefix, though it depends on the output of IntelliJ.

The following is an example which will keep the config.yml files in sync, and the README.md files in sync (separately):

gocopyfw -d $ProjectFileDir$ -f $FilePath$ -l /config.yml;/internal/config.yml;/internal/configuration/config.yml,/README.md;/internal/README.md

```

### Options

```
  -f, --file-path string          the file path from $FilePath$
  -h, --help                      help for gocopyfw
  -l, --linked-files strings      a list of files that are linked, each set of files is separated by commas and each file in the set is separated by a semicolon
  -d, --project-file-dir string   the project root directory from $ProjectFileDir$
```
